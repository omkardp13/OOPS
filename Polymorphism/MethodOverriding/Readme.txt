Method Overriding:Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in superclass.


Yes, you are correct. In the provided code, although the virtual and override keywords are not used, method overriding is still happening. In C#, when you have a method in a base class and a method with the same signature in a derived class, the method in the derived class automatically overrides the method in the base class.

However, it's important to note that without the virtual keyword in the base class, you won't be able to explicitly indicate that the method is designed to be overridden. The virtual keyword is a way to express the intention that a method can be overridden in derived classes.

Additionally, without the override keyword in the derived class, you won't get a compiler warning if the method in the derived class doesn't actually override a method in the base class. Using override explicitly tells the compiler that you are intentionally providing a new implementation for a method in the base class.

So, while method overriding is occurring implicitly in your code, using virtual and override provides better clarity, documentation, and helps avoid accidental mistakes. It's generally recommended to use these keywords when you are designing classes for explicit method overriding.
